<h1>Welcome to the Tor network!</h1>
<h3>This is a simple site meant for me to mess around with darkhttpd and web hosting, hi</h3>


<p>I also might as well teach you about proper OPSEC while I'm here. The short version is don't be a dumbass, turn off JavaScript as 99% of .onion websites won't need it and it can be used to deanonymize you, and I would personally recommend using a privacy-focused OS like Tails, Qubes, or Whonix.</p>


<p>Good OPSEC takes a little bit to learn. Go browse <a href="http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/">Dread</a> or watch some YouTube videos, I like watching Mental Outlaw, he makes good content.</p>


<p>If you want to quickly get around Tor, go to <a href="https://tor.taxi/">tor.taxi</a>, but I recommend you visit <a href="http://tortaxi2dev6xjwbaydqzla77rrnth7yn2oqzjfmiuwn5h6vsk2a4syd.onion/">their onion</a> instead.


<h4>Thank you for visiting my silly little website! Enjoy browsing Tor, and remember to stay safe out there.</h4>

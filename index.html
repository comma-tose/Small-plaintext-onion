<h1>Welcome to the Tor network!</h1>
<h3>This is a simple site meant for me to mess around with darkhttpd and web hosting, hi</h3>


<p>One of the quickest ways to find websites on Tor is by using a site like <a href="http://tortaxi2dev6xjwbaydqzla77rrnth7yn2oqzjfmiuwn5h6vsk2a4syd.onion/">tor.taxi</a> which has links to many onions.</p>
  

<h4>Thank you for visiting my silly little website! Enjoy browsing Tor, and remember to stay safe out there.</h4>
